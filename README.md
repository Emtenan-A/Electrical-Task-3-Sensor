## Electrical-Task-3-Sensor
### The Third Task Of the Electrical Department is to make a Digital Sensor Circuit
In this task, an electronic circuit containing a digital sensor (ultrasonic sensor) was made, and its function is to calculate the distance and display it on the serial monitor. Ultrasonic sensor works by using sound waves and finding time to calculate the distance of any object. In addition, there are a LED and a buzzer. To illustrate, if the distance is less than 100 cm, the LED will open and the buzzer also. The circuit was made using TinkerCad

### At distances more than 100 cm

The object is 157 cm away in the next figure. As you can see. The LED and the buzzer are switched on.

### At distances less than 100 cm

The object is 35 cm away in the next figure. As you can see. The LED and the buzzer are switched off.
